Project description:  For this topic, I'm going to use a pre-trained convolutional network(ResNet) to implement image classification. According to the requirement of the topic, there is a comparison between the ResNet and its randomly initialized neural network going to be shown. The comparison is about the time complexity of training and the accuracy of image classification. The dataset for this project would be CIFAR-10, which is a small dataset, sum up all the samples, there are only 60000 images for training and testing.
